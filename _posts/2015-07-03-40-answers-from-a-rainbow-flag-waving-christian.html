  Here is my response:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>How long have you believed that gay marriage is something to be
      celebrated?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have supported same-sex marriage at least since I came to terms with my
      sexuality, but I never opposed same-sex marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>How long have you believed that same-sex marriage is something to be
      condemned?</i>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>What Bible verses led you to change your mind?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was coming to terms with the fact that I cannot change my sexuality,
      I studied Scripture and learned that all direct references to homosexual
      behavior are in the context of shrine temple sex or idolatry. I learned
      that what I had be taught about homosexuality was wrong.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>How would you make a positive case from Scripture that sexual activity
      between two persons of the same sex is a blessing to be celebrated?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no condemnation of loving, committed same-sex relations in the
      Bible. I believe that God’s declaration in Genesis 2:18 applies in full
      force to people of all sexual orientations. It is "not good" that we be
      alone, and when we find the suitable partner that God has for us, we
      simply want the same type of relationship that opposite-sex couples enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>How would you make a positive case from Scripture that sexual activity
      between two persons of the same sex is always condemned?</i>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>What verses would you use to show that a marriage between two persons
      of the same sex can adequately depict Christ and the church?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I see no verses that state that two persons of the same sex cannot
      adequately depict Christ and the church. Scripture’s depiction of David
      and Jonathan’s love is uses the same language that is used to refer to the
      love embodied by opposite-sex couples. After Jonathan’s death ended their
      15-or-so year relationship, Scripture tells us that David married Princess
      Michal because he wanted to become Saul’s son-in-law. The text never says
      that David loved Princess Michal. Scripture is clear that the the souls of
      David and Jonathan were knit together and that David loved Jonathan "more
      than any woman." To me, the story of David and Jonathan does not read like
      a mere friendship.

    <p>
      <b>Do you think Jesus would have been okay with homosexual behavior
      between consenting adults in a committed relationship?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>If so, why did he reassert the Genesis definition of marriage as being
      one man and one woman?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn't. In Matthew 19, Jesus was answering a questio about divorce, not
      defining marrigage. Such a reading reads into the text what is not there.
      And the Genesis definition of marriage doesn't necessarily exclude same-sex
      couples either.

    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      <b>When Jesus spoke against <i>porneia</i> what sins do you think he was
      forbidding?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>porneia</i>: "fornication, whoredom; met: idolatry" (Strong’s Greek),
      "a selling off (surrendering) of sexual purity" (HELPS Word-studies)
      (<a target="_blank" href="http://biblehub.com/greek/4202.htm">http://biblehub.com/greek/4202.htm</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Porneia</i> is translated sexual immorality, whoredom, fornication, and
      idolatry. It is derived from <i>porné</i> which means prostitute, so I
      would conclude that <i>porneia</i> has to do with the selling of sex.
      There is no evidence that porneia is inclusive of homosexuality.

      <b>If some homosexual behavior is acceptable, how do you understand the
      sinful "exchange" Paul highlights in Romans 1?</b>
    </p>
    <blockquote class="normal-size">
      <p>
        <i>Romans 18-20 NIV</i>: The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven
        against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the
        truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to
        them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of
        the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine
        nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made,
        so that people are without excuse.

        <i>Romans 1:21-23 NIV</i>: For although they knew God, they neither
        glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became
        futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed
        to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal
        God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and
        animals and reptiles.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In verses 21-23, Paul says that they "exchanged the glory of the immortal
      God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and
      animals and reptiles" because they knew God and did not glorify Him. This
      is a direct reference to idol worship.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="normal-size">

        <i>Romans 1:25-25 NIV</i>: Therefore God gave them over in the sinful

        bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth about God for a lie,
        and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is
        forever praised. Amen.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <i>(transition "therefore")</i> In verses 24-27, Paul says that the people
      "exchanged the truth about God for a lie" and as a result "worshiped and
      served created things rather than the Creator." This is also a direct
      reference to idol worship.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="normal-size">
      <p>
        <i>Romans 1:26-27 NIV</i>: Because of this, God gave them over to
        shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations
        for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural
        relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men
        committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the
        due penalty for their error.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <i>(transition "because of this")</i> In verses 26-27, Paul mentions
      "shameful lusts" and "[abandoning] natural relations with women". Paul was
      making an argument against idolatry A common part of idol worship in
      Paul’s day was shrine temple sex -- men who were married to women would
      have extramarital sex with shrine temple prostitutes in order to please
      the fertility god. The sinful exchange in Romans 1 is not homosexuality.
      It is idolatry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romans 1:26-27 is not a description of a person with an innate, immutable
      same-sex attraction who is pursuing a committed, loving relationship with
      a person of the same sex. We can easily tell the difference between
      committed love and lustful idolatry in regard to opposite-sex
      relationships. We only ask that you see the same difference in regard to
      same-sex relationships.

      <b>Do you believe that passages like 1 Corinthians 6:9 and Revelation 21:8
      teach that sexual immorality can keep you out of heaven?</b>

    <p>
      I believe that Jesus died for all sins, including sexual immorality.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>What sexual sins do you think they were referring to?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Put simply, sex outside a committed, lifelong relationship (i.e. marriage):
      rape, adultery, prostitution, etc. And I believe that forgiveness is
      available for every one of these.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 Corinthians 6:9-10 uses two terms that, in recent translations, are
      rendered to refer to some form of homosexual behaviour. While Paul most
      likely was referring to certain forms of homosexual behaviour,
      <i>malakoi</i> and <i>arsenokoitai</i> do not refer to homosexuality as an
      orientation or inside a committed relationship. <i>Malakoi</i> was not
      rendered as "homosexual" until the translation of the Amplified Bible in
      1958. This is a relatively new change in translation.

    <blockquote class="normal-size">
      <p>
        When anti-gay conservative Calvinists like Phil Johnson support the gay
        Christian view, that the cultural, historical, religious context of 1
        Corinthians 6 was temple prostitution, that is an important admission.
        Honest students of the Bible should pay attention to Phil Johnson on
        this issue and consider the possibility that <i>malakoi</i> and
        <i>arsenokoitai</i> described shrine prostitutes who served pagan gods
        in the idol temples of Corinth. That form of idolatry was a problem for
        Jews in the Old Testament and Christians in the New Testament.

      <b>As you think about the long history of the church and the near
      universal disapproval of same-sex sexual activity, what do you think you
      understand about the Bible that Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, and Luther
      failed to grasp?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I think most people look at passages of scripture that do not directly
      affect them and simply take the text at it appears without looking at
      translation and context to derive the author’s intended meaning. I also
      understand sexual orientation in a way that these people likely did not --
      and in a way that Paul did not. Paul referred to the behavior that he
      witnessed in his culture and society and rightly saw that it was wrong.
      However, homosexual behavior comes in different forms. Paul condemned
      lustful idolatry, not committed love between persons of the same sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      As noted above, the translation of <i>malakoi</i> has only recently been
      rendered as "homosexual." The interpretation and application of Scripture
      has changed over time. Examples include the view that Earth stands still,
      support for slavery, banning interracial marriage, and holding men as
      superior to women. These positions are now rightly viewed as incorrect,
      and I believe the position that committed, loving same-sex relationships
      are somehow sinful is also incorrect.

      <b>What arguments would you use to explain to Christians in Africa, Asia,

      incorrect and your new understanding of homosexuality is not culturally
      conditioned?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      My understanding of homosexuality is not culturally conditioned. It is
      based on my personal experience. The idea that my feelings were somehow
      inherently wrong is what was culturally conditioned, and I’ve come to
      learn that I what I was taught was harmful to me. As for the first half
      your question, I would use the same arguments that I use here to convince
      Christians in the United States that homosexuality is not wrong.

    <p>
      I don't assume that anyone who disagrees with me is "motivated by personal
      animus and bigotry" when they disagree with my on this subject. That

      We have a lot of children who are in foster homes and who are waiting to

      <b>If yes, does the church or the state have any role to play in promoting

    </p>
    <p>
      N/A. I believe that same-sex couples should be allowed to adopt children,
      and I see no reason to keep children in a foster home or children’s home
      when there are couples available who are willing to love and care for them
      as their own. And adoption is undeniably a core part of God's plan.

    <p>
      <b>Does the end and purpose of marriage point to something more than an
      adult’s emotional and sexual fulfillment?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Marriage is a reflection of Christ's love for the Church. And I see
      no reason that a Christ-centered relationship between a man and woman can
      reflect that while a Christ-centered relationship between persons of the
      same-sex cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      But both emotional and sexual fulfillment are important in marriage.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>How would you define marriage?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Christian sense, marriage is a committed, loving, monogamous,
      lifelong, Christ-centered relationship between two adults who seek to
      glorify God through their commitment to each other.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Do you think close family members should be allowed to get married?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      No. And supporting same-sex marriage does not weaken that position.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Should marriage be limited to only two people?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. And supporting same-sex marriage does not weaken that position.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>On what basis, if any, would you prevent consenting adults of any
      relation and of any number from getting married?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Supporting same-sex marriage does not place the burden of disproving
      slippery slope arguments on me. A person in support of incest or polygamy
      would have to prevent their own arguments.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Should there be an age requirement in this country for obtaining a
      marriage license?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Does equality entail that anyone wanting to be married should be able
      to have any meaningful relationship defined as marriage?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>If not, why not?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not believe children or closely related person should be get married.
      And my arguments against child marriage or incest marriage would probably
      be the same as yours, but I am not sliding down the slippery slope today.
      Marriage is a mutually consenting relationship/contract between adults.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Should your brothers and sisters in Christ who disagree with homosexual
      practice be allowed to exercise their religious beliefs without fear of
      punishment, retribution, or coercion?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. But exercising your beliefs does not include discrimination in
      housing, employment, or public accommodations. Churches are free to
      discriminate as they always have been (e.g. Jewish rabbis are not required
      to perform marriages between Jews and non-Jews even after Loving v.
      Virginia).
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that all employers, hospitals, and insurance companies, etc.
      hould be required to recognize all legal marriages for the purposes of
      benefits, medical visitation, and medical decision making, etc. I believe
      that all business that are open to the public should be required to serve
      their customers without discriminating based on sexual orientation or
      gender identity (and some jurisdictions have added one or both to their
      list of protected classes). I believe that discrimination against same-sex
      couple in housing would also be wrong.

      <b>Will you speak up for your fellow Christians when their jobs, their
      accreditation, their reputation, and their freedoms are threatened because
      of this issue?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It depends on the circumstance. If a state official loses their job or is
      moved to a new position for refusing to issue or sign legal marriage
      licenses, I will not speak out in their support. If a nurse, doctor, etc.
      refuses to care for a LGBT person or a person with same-sex or LGBT
      parents, I will not speak out in their support. If a hospital employee
      refuses to allow a patient’s spouse visitation or decision-making
      authority, I will not speak out in their support. If a pastor is punished
      by the state or federal government for refusing to marry any couple in
      his/her church, I will call that what it is: unconstitutional.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Will you speak out against shaming and bullying of all kinds, whether
      against gays and lesbians or against Evangelicals and Catholics?</b>

    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Since the evangelical church has often failed to take unbiblical
      divorces and other sexual sins seriously, what steps will you take to
      ensure that gay marriages are healthy and accord with Scriptural
      principles?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The same steps that should be taken to ensure that opposite-sex marriages
      "are healthy and accord with Scriptural principles." I'm not sure why it
      should be different.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Should gay couples in open relationships be subject to church
      discipline?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not not sure what the author means by "open relationships." If the
      author refers to discipline for a same-sex couple making their
      relationship public, absolutely not. If the author refers to discipline
      for a couple that is not strictly monogamous, I believe the same teachings
      applied to opposite-sex couples in regard to monogamy should be applied.
      If the latter is what the author meant by "open relationship," I should
      note that the question is out of place. LGBT persons should not be assumed
      to be automatically promiscuous just as straight persons aren’t.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Is it a sin for LGBT persons to engage in sexual activity outside of
      marriage?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is is a sin for straight persons "to engage in sexual activity outside of
      marriage"? Same answer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>What will open and affirming churches do to speak prophetically against
      divorce, fornication, pornography, and adultery wherever they are
      found?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The same thing that non-affirming churches do expect for focusing on
      homosexuality being a sin as seems to be the pattern. The listed sins in
      this question are not inclusive of homosexuality.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>If "love wins," how would you define love?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      1 Corinthians 13 contains the best definition of love that I can find.
    </p>
    <p>
      My understanding of the #LoveWins campaign is that the love embodied by
      same-sex couples is not somehow lesser than the love embodied by
      opposite-sex couples.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Would you define love in a way that excludes same-sex couples? If so,
      what basis in Scripture would you have to hold that persons of the
      same-sex cannot be in a loving relationship?</i>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>What verses would you use to establish that definition?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      1 Corinthians 13.

      <b>How should obedience to God’s commands shape our understanding of
      love?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Obedience to God is certainly part of out individual expression of love to
      God. Scripture makes that clear, especially 1 John. However, my
      understanding of love certainly does not include constantly telling gay
      people are sinning just as I don’t constantly tell other people that they
      are sinning.

      <b>Do you believe it is possible to love someone and disagree with
      important decisions they make?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. And based on the subtext of this question, I must note that being gay
      (or LGBT in general) is not a choice.

      <b>If supporting gay marriage is a change for you, has anything else
      changed in your understanding of faith?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Support of same-sex marriage is not a change for me, but I’ll answer the
      question. My faith is constantly improving. Over the past several years,
      I have learned the importance of service. I serve very faithfully in my
      church and in my campus ministry. And over the past two years, I have
      learned the importance of community - the importance of having people
      around me who care about me and the importance of caring about them.

      <b>As an evangelical, how has your support for gay marriage helped you
      become more passionate about traditional evangelical distinctives like
      a focus on being born again, the substitutionary sacrifice of Christ on
      the cross, the total trustworthiness of the Bible, and the urgent need to
      evangelize the lost?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      My support of same-sex marriage doesn’t diminish my "focus on being born
      again, the substitutionary sacrifice of Christ on the cross, the total
      trustworthiness of the Bible, and the urgent need to evangelize the lost"
      in any way. I certainly believe in the trustworthiness of the Bible, but
      that also includes understanding the original intent of the authors. Being
      in a minority that is viewed negatively by many in the Church helps me to
      understand that Jesus is available for everyone. Jesus himself ministered
      primarily to the outcast minorities of his day.

      <b>What open and affirming churches would you point to where people are
      being converted to orthodox Christianity, sinners are being warned of
      judgment and called to repentance, and missionaries are being sent out to
      plant churches among unreached peoples?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I really doubt that those qualities are missing in all open and affirming
      churches. But not all churches minister to people via warnings of
      judgement. Love should come first. I know that open and affirming churches
      are trying their best to reach out to LGBT persons who have been rejected
      by other churches because their "warnings of judgement" displaced their
      love.

      <i>Do you think that the highly negative impact more

      Yes, as if my support of same-sex marriage would somehow change that. I
      always seek to deepen my understanding of Christ’s love for us.

      <b>When Paul at the end of Romans 1 rebukes "those who practice such

    <blockquote class="normal-size">

        <i>Romans 1:29-32 NIV</i>: They have become filled with every kind of
        wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder,
        strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters,
        insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they
        disobey their parents; they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no
        mercy. Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such
        things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but
        also approve of those who practice them.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      directly from the text: envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, gossiping,
      slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, boasting, disobedience to
      parents, lack of understanding, lack of fidelity, lack of love, lack of
      mercy

    <p>
      Romans 1:18-32 is discussions about the root and effects of idolatry. And
      committed, loving relationships between persons of the same sex are not
      condemned. The only discussion of homosexual behavior in Romans 1, or
      actually in all of the Bible, is behavior in relation to idolatry,
      specifically shrine temple sex.
