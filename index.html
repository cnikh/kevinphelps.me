      Hi! My name is Kevin Phelps. I am a Computer Science student at Southeast
      Missouri State Unversity. I focus on web development, and I have a passion
      for using technology to help people - to save time, to be more productive,
      to be more efficient, and to enjoy their jobs and lives more. If I can use
      my passion to help others be able to enjoy their passions, I am happy.
    </p>

      Currently, I work as a Software Developer at MedAssets and as a Teacher's
      Assistant in the Computer Science department at my university. At
      MedAssets, I do various web development tasks including developing
      internal reporting tools and enhancing client-facing applications. As a
      Teacher's Assistant, I help students learn to program in their lab
      assignments.

      Previously, I have worked in three other departments at Southeast Missouri
      State University in software/web development and technical support roles.
      I was instrumental in the university's transition from our home-grown
      Learning Management System (LMS) to Moodle (an open-source LMS). During
      that time, I wrote several tools to ease the transition for faculty
      including a tool to convert test banks which saved hundreds of hours of
      tedious manual work.
