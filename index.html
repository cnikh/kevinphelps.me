      Hi! My name is Kevin Phelps. I graduated from Southeast Missouri State
      Unversity with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I focus on web
      development, and I have a passion for using technology to help people - to
      save time, to be more productive, to be more efficient, and to enjoy their
      jobs and lives more.
