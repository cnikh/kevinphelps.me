  This portfolio links to some of the projects I have worked in my college and
  professional careers. This page does not yet have all of the projects I plan
  to include in my portfolio. You should also check out
  <a href="/resume.html">my Résumé</a> which lists more details about my
  experience and projects and
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kevinphelps/">my GitHub account</a>
  which hosts code for some of my projects.

      When I worked at Southeast Missori State Univerisity with the transition
      to the Moodle LMS, we needed a way to present help content to faculty. We
      had several categories each with three subcategories and some of our help
      articles fit into more than one subcategory. I built this help interface
      based on mockups designed by a co-worker. There are categories down the
      right side of the page. When you click a category, the page dynamically
      changes the subcategories with display below the selected article. Each
      article has a Guidesheet PDF and/or a tutorial video which open in modal
      dialogs.

      I wrote a web server program in my my Data Communications class to
      demonstrate my knowledge of the HTTP protocol. Beyond the requirements for
      this project, I included support for HTTP Keep-Alive (persistent
      connection), PHP rendering, request timeouts, etc.
