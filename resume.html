    <legend>SUMMARY</legend>

    <p>
      I am a Computer Science student at Southeast Missouri State Unversity. I
      focus on web development, and I have a passion for using technology to
      help people - to save time, to be more productive, to be more efficient,
      and to enjoy their jobs and lives more. If I can use my passion to help
      others be able to enjoy their passions, I am happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I work as a Software Developer at MedAssets and as a Teacher's
      Assistant in the Computer Science department at my university. AtMedAssets,
      I do various web development tasks including developing internal reporting
      tools and enhancing client-facing applications. As a Teacher's Assistant,
      I help students learn to program in their lab assignments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously, I have worked in three other departments at Southeast Missouri
      State University in software/web development and technical support roles.
      I was instrumental in the university's transition from our home-grown
      Learning Management System (LMS) to Moodle (an open-source LMS). During
      that time, I wrote several tools to ease the transition for faculty
      including a tool to convert test banks which saved hundreds of hours of
      tedious manual work.
